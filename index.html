					<p> 
						To be a member of this club, all that is officially required is your email address. All official correspondence will be done through email. However, your club experience will dramatically improve if you join our Discord server. We'd recommend making an account if you don't have one already. Our server can be found <a href="https://discord.gg/V4V4t85KKk">here</a>. We also gave every club member in the server a club member role. With this role, you can access the private club-text channels. We've also noticed a few people included their Discord username in the registration form but did not join our club server. Please manually join our server if you did this because you expected to use Discord.

					<small>2. Executives</small>
					<p> 
						The results of our recent election have finally been validated, and I am pleased to announce our new executive team.

						Chancellor: Kenny Moc
						President: Paul Le
						Treasurer: Jack MacArthur

						For the Executive Positions:
						Bakare Abdulrahman, Tioluwani Akinloye, Victoria Burman, Ted Byun, Hiritikk Kumar, Kim Le, 
						Lucy Liu, Armaan Mangat, Khushi Mittal, Shariq Naiyer, Shubham Saharan, Nasif Qadri

				<div class="col-md-10 col-sm-6">
					<small>3. Volunteering</small>
					<p> 
						Currently on our to-do list that we could use some help with is: improving/managing the website, maintaing and handling social media accounts, and creating a logo (we don't really have the rights to operate under our current logo, but hacker-culture says to be anti-authoritarian and not respect intellectual property rights).

					<small>4. Club Room</small>

					<small>5. Social Nights / Weekly Meetings</small>
					<p> 
						If there's enough interest and we can get a designated spot (I.e. club room) then we can definitely do this. Again, this club is as much mine as anyone else's. The organization is meant to bring CHADS-ists together. So if anyone wanted to take the reins on organizing something like this, feel free. Just please let me know so that we can make it "club official."

				<!-- Chancellor's Thanks -->

						Lastly, thank you all for being a part of the club. I am excited about everything to come.
